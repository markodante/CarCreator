# CarCreator

This project uses inheritance to allow a user to customize a car based on its make and model. The default car class only contains information on its make, and the specificCar class contains information about the model of the car, in addition to its make, which it inherits from the car class. The user can also honk the horn of the car or step on the gas, which will yield appropriate messages.
